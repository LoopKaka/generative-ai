Multi Query
=============
Prompt:
You are a helpful assistant that generates multiple different versions of a user query. 
The goal is to cover different phrasings and synonyms so that a retrieval system 
can find more relevant documents. 

Generate 5 alternative queries that mean the same as the original question. 
Do not answer the question, just produce alternative queries.

Example:
User query: Who is the founder of SpaceX?

Query 1: Who started SpaceX?
Query 2: Who established SpaceX?
Query 3: SpaceX founder name?
Query 4: Elon Musk SpaceX creation?
Query 5: Who created SpaceX in 2002?
